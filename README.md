timonieris
====

This is supposed to be a toy project for me to practise Haskell.
The following concepts of Haskell shall be explored:

- Composition
- Extensibility
- Multithreaded environment

So what is this project about? The name __timonieris__ is a Greek word for
"steerman", which means you should be able to orchestrate defined list of tasks. Task file is found at your home folder under **.timonieris**

## Task definition syntax: TBD
